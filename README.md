# **Dashboard (React App):**
This application is a digital signage content builder studio that allows users to create interactive and dynamic display layouts. Using a canvas interface powered by frameworks like Fabric.js, users can drag and drop various widgets (e.g., headers, sliders, weather displays, time/date shows, iframes) to design their custom content. The platform offers a creative space for users to craft unique digital signage, enabling them to arrange and customize elements to meet their specific display needs.
  - Uses Fabric.js to provide a canvas-based content builder.
  - Automatically sends canvas updates (as JSON) to a WebSocket server.
